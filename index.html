    This webpage contains information about me and my experience in the field
    of computer science. It also acts as a home page for all of my future GUI I
    homework assignments.

            <h3>Synchronous Post Office Simulation (November 2019)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a multithreaded program wherein ‘sender’ threads take turns sending random objects to randomly selected<br>
                  ‘receiver’ threads through a single shared buffer </li>
                <li>Implemented in C++, fully synchronized using mutual exclusivity lock mechanisms</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reversible Image Encryption (February 2019)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a program that accepts a .png file and a password, which is used to scramble the pixels of the file,<br>
                  resulting in a new encrypted image that resembles television static</li>
                <li>If the user resubmits the encrypted .png file with the same password, the program will return the original, unscrambled image</li>
                <li>Implemented in C++ using SFML libraries, compiled through Ubuntu command line</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Created a cheating hangman program that guarantees each game will require as many guesses as possible, no matter<br>
                  what letter the user guesses each turn</li>
                <li>Implemented in C using an AVL tree of custom vector structures containing custom string structures, debugged with a<br>
                  unit test framework, compiled through Ubuntu command line</li>
